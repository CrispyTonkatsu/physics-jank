# Todo
- Migrating to macroquad (This should be short, aka 20 mins)

- Implementing constraint solver for contact constraints (This could take forever or 2 hours)

- Generating the manifold for the collision solver (This could be 30 mins to an hour)
- Implementing rotational physics to the contact constraint (This could also take forver to 2 hours)

- Implementing this in the C++ na engine (This is mainly a refactor so it will take 2 hours)
- Implementing check-here method for physics_process (make sure to have a way to check whether the call is being done inside the physics_process just to guarantee that there is no misusage) (This should take 30 mins)
- Exposing constraints to lua such that more constraints can be made there (Bindings so 1 hour)
