Notes on how to proceed:
- Calculate the correct contact points:
    - [Reference](https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic/588070-seperating-axis-theorem---how-to-resolve-contact-points/)
    - [Reference 2](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/game/mastersdegree/gametechnologies/previousinformation/physics5collisionmanifolds/2017%20Tutorial%205%20-%20Collision%20Manifolds.pdf)
- Design the constraint pipeline
- Refer to the [GDC presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHinxAhv1ZE)
- Implement a position solver
- Implement an impulse solver
- Consider implementing continuous collision detection (This is not for na-engine, so it can wait)
